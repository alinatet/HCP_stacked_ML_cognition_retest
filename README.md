# HCP_stacked_ML_cognition_retest

Set of Python3 and Shell scripts used to calculate the stacked machine learning prediction of the Cognition Total Composite Score in the main HCP Young Adult dataset (S1200 release), and the test-retest reliability these predicted scores in HCP Young Adult retest set (45 subjects).

These scripts are intended more as "recipes" than ready-to-use scripts. They will need editing to match your local folder/file naming settings. Check each script carefully before running it.  

Additional software need to be installed:

- wb_command (HCP Workbench Command)
- FSL
- FreeSurfer
